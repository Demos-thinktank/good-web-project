  - paragraph: "The Good Web Project articulates the vision for an internet compatible with liberal democracy. We create the evidence base and principles for policy makers and opinion leaders in liberal democracies worldwide to advocate for an internet in robust contrast to authoritarian models. We believe that with a mix of policy, dialogue and a granular understanding of technology, the internet will be the place where democracy is redefined in the 21st century."
  - paragraph: "Without evidence for what works online, and without a principled vision for the internet, our democratic traditions, government and society will fall behind authoritarian states and technopolistic industry giants in the race to reshape the most important international political, cultural and social space in existence."
  - paragraph: "We must not focus on what we donâ€™t want, and forget about what we do"
