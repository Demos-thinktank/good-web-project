security-and-sovereignty:
  description:
    - paragraph: "Both Russia and China are formulating and implementing their versions of ‘internet sovereignty’, a vision based on censorship and state control. Democracies need to define a liberal doctrine of security and sovereignty, one that recognises the threats caused by information operations and cyber attacks, foreign and domestic, as well as online crime, but also guarantees freedoms and the free flow of information across borders."
    - paragraph: "In order to explore this we need to ask what does effective policing of online spaces look like. We need to define what role should be played by international institutions in defending the liberal democratic web."
    - paragraph: "Do we need a ‘digital NATO’ to counter political warfare and hybrid threats? Should we let tech companies from hostile states into our digital infrastructure?"

the-digital-citizen:
  description:
    - paragraph: "Authoritarian countries such as China tell their subjects they will have no rights or privacy online. Total surveillance, they claim, will lead to better services and more convenience. Concurrently ad-revenue driven ‘surveillance capitalism’ is also criticised for exploiting citizens."
    - paragraph: "What compelling counter-offer can democracies propose for their citizens? How can the internet better democratically enfranchise its users? What does it mean to have ‘rights’ and privacy online, and when do these values really matter to people? How can we ensure them?"

the-digital-commons:
  description:
    - paragraph: "Digital technology has undermined the assumptions we have long made about the democratic information space. The assumption that fallacious information would lose the competition in a marketplace of ideas has been undermined by the ease with which disinformation can be produced."
    - paragraph: "The belief that pluralism would automatically lead to higher quality debate has also been undermined by vicious polarisation. It is no longer easy to define the difference between a democratic information space and an authoritarian one: in both we see the use of coordinated inauthentic behaviour and the mass production of disinformation; in both we see regimes breaking down the potential for reasoned, deliberative debate by generating mistrust, conspiracies and the construction of in-out groups; in both we see moves to censor and remove content as a means to manage the harms perceived online"
